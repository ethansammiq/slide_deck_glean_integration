## 🔍 Glean Search Strategy

The system executes 4 targeted search categories:

1. **Case Studies**: `"case study [industry] campaign success metrics"`
2. **Industry Insights**: `"[industry] advertising trends KPIs benchmarks"`  
3. **Tactical Expertise**: `"programmatic display video optimization"`
4. **Client-Specific**: `"[brand] proposal RFP previous work"`

Each search includes facet filters for:
- Document types: presentations, documents, PDFs
